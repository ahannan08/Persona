Realtime chat app with websockets using Node.js, Express and Socket.io with Vanilla JS on the frontend with a custom UI

This project is based on Backend Techs like NodeJS, Express And Socket.io integrated with Html and CSS. 
this chat application displays my ability to understand the working of backend and enhancing my problem solving skills that i encountered whilst working on this. I am interested to make modifications to current application in coming few days.

## Usage
```
npm install
node server.js

Go to localhost:3001
```

## Notes
The *_html_css* folder is just a starter template to follow along with the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD7FnbI76Hg&t=1339s. It is not part of the app
